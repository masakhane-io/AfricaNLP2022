Hasse grew up in Sweden but has lived in Atlanta the last 7 years. A large part of his research experience has focused on genetic and hormonal perspectives on pair-bonding (monogamous) behavior. Hasse currently works as an Instructor at the Marcus Autism Center, studying the role of developmental gene expression patterns in autism. Some of Hasseâ€™s other interest include coding in R, scientific rigor and reproducibility, and creative writing.
