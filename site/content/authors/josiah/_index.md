Josiah Parry is a person of eclectic interests; some of which are social science, politics, espresso, data science, and music. I get to indulge in many of these interests as a Customer Success Representative at RStudio. Josiah is also the author of the [genius](https://github.com/josiahparry/genius) package and a contributor to [spotifyr](https://github.com/charlie86/spotifyr).
